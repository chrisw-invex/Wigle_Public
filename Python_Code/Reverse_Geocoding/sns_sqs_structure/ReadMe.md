- This code is meant to reverse geocode on a large database table
- In order to process a lot of data I chose to take advantage of the aws sqs queue and sns topic technology in order to process the data
- The idea was to distribute the data through an sqs queue to multiple ec2s for processing
- There was one ec2 which was considered the "hub" and would publish the data to an sns topic with the endpoint of the queue
